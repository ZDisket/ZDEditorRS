# Firebird configuration file
#
# Comments
# --------
# The # character is used for comments and can be placed anywhere on a
# line.  Anything following the # character on a line is considered a
# comment.
#
# Examples:
#
#    # This is a comment
#    DefaultDbCachePages = 2048   # This is an end-of-line comment
#
# Entries
# -------
# The default value for each entry is listed to the right of the "=".
# To activate an entry, remove the leading "#"s and supply the desired
# value.
#
# Please note, a number of the values are specified in **Bytes** (Not KB).
# Accordingly, we have provided some simple conversion tables at the bottom
# of this file.
#
# There are three types of configuration values: integer, boolean and string.
# 
# Integer
# --------
# Integers is what they sound like, an integral value. Examples:
#   1
#   42
#   4711
# 
# Boolean
# -------
# Boolean is expressed as integer values with 0 (zero) being "false" and
# non-zero is taken to mean "true". For consistency we recommend you
# only use 0/1.
# 
# String
# ------
# Strings are also what they sound like, strings. Examples:
#   RootDirectory  = /opt/firebird
#   RemotePipeName = pipe47

# Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry
# (see above). Default value 'Full' gives full access to all files

# ----------------------------
# 
# Determines the number of seconds that the lock manager will wait after a

# ----------------------------
#
# How often the pages are flushed on disk

#
# The TCP Service name/Port number to be used for client database

#
# Type: string, integer
#
#RemoteServiceName = gds_db

#RemoteAuxPort = 0

#
# TCP/IP buffer size for send and receive buffers of both the client
# and server. The engine reads ahead of the client and can send

#
# Type: string
#
#RemoteBindAddress = 


# ----------------------------
# Locking and shared memory parameters
#
# Bytes of shared memory allocated for lock manager. 
# In Classic mode, the size given is used for the initial allocation. The
# table expands dynamically up to the limit of memory. In SuperServer, the
# initial size is also the final size.
# Default is 96K on Linux and Solaris, 256K on Windows.
#
# Type: integer
#
#LockMemSize = 262144

#
# Number of semaphores for interprocess communication.
# In non-threading environments, this sets the number of semaphores

#
# Type: integer
#
#LockSemCount = 32

#
# When a connection wants to lock an object, it gets a lock request 
# block which specifies the object and the lock level requested. Eack
# locked object has a lock block. Request blocks are connected to those
# lock blocks either as requests that have been granted, or as pending
# requests. 
#
# The settings:
# 	1 means locks are granted first come, first served.
#	0 means emulate InterBase v3.3 behavior, where locks are granted 
#	  as soon as they are available; can result in lock request
#       starvation.
#
# Type: integer/boolean
#
#LockGrantOrder = 1

#
# In Classic, only one client process may access the lock table at any
# time. Access to the lock table is governed by a mutex. The mutex can
# be requested conditionally -a wait is a failure and the request must
# be retried - or unconditionally - the request will wait until it is
# satisfied. This parameter establishes the number of attempts that
# will be made conditionally. Relevant only on SMP machines.
#
# Type: boolean
#
#LockRequireSpins = 0

# Tune lock hash list; more hash slots mean shorter hash chains. Only

# ===========================
# SuperServer Engine Settings
# ===========================
#
# ----------------------------
# Which CPUs should be used (Windows Only)
#
# In an SMP system, sets which processors can be used by the server.  
# The value is taken from a bit map in which each bit represents a CPU.
# Thus, to use only the first processor, the value is 1. To use both
# CPU 1 and CPU 2, the value is 3. To use CPU 2 and CPU 3, the value
# is 6. The default value is 1.
#
# Type: integer
#
#CpuAffinityMask = 1


# ----------------------------
# Settings for the thread scheduler (Windows Only)
#
# The wait time, in milli-seconds (ms), before the priority of:
#	- an inactive thread is reduced to 'Low', or 
#	- an active thread is increased to 'High'
#
# Note: The default value was chosen based on experiments on Intel 
# PIII/P4 processors.  It should be increased for using in the computer
# with lower speed processors.
#
# Type: integer
#
#PrioritySwitchDelay = 100

#
# Number of cycles of the scheduler (PrioritySwitchDelay ms) before
# thread are destroyed/closed.  Rather than immediately destroy/closed
# worker threads (which would require a semaphore and blocking call --
# significant overhead), the thread scheduler maintains a pool of the
# threads.  When a thread has completed it's task/work, it is marked as
# idle.  The idle thread is destroyed/closed after X iterations of the
# scheduler loop.
#
# For a server with a very large number of connections (presumably more
# than several hundred) the setting value should be increased. 
#
# The setting represents the number of loop iterations to be made before
# the thread is destroyed/closed.
#
# Type: integer
#
#DeadThreadsCollection = 50

#
# Number of additional 'intervals' given to a 'High' priority thread.
#
# Type: integer

# ----------------------------
# Does the guardian restart the server every time it crashes?
#    0 - only start the engine/service once
#    1 - always restart the engine/service if it terminates
#
# Type: integer/boolean
#
#GuardianOption = 1


#
# ----------------------------
# Priority level/class for the server process.
#
# The values are:
#     0 (Zero) - normal priority,
#     positive value - high priority (same as -B command line option)
#     negative value - low priority.
#
# Note: All changes to this value should be carefully tested to ensure
# that engine is more responsive to requests.
#
# Type: integer
#
#ProcessPriorityLevel = 0


# ----------------------------
# Local Connection Settings
#
# Size in bytes of one client's portion of the memory mapped file used
# for local connections.
#
# Type: integer
#
#IpcMapSize= 4096

# The name of the shared memory area used as a transport channel in local protocol.
# The default value is not compatible with IB/FB1. Use value 'InterBaseIPI' to
# restore compatibility, if necessary.
#
# Type: string
#
#IpcName = FirebirdIPI

#
# The name of the pipe used as a transport channel in NetBEUI protocol.
# Has the same meaning as a port number for TCP/IP. The default value is
# compatible with IB/FB1.
#
# Type: string
#
#RemotePipeName = interbas

# 
# Does the server need to create a (hidden) window used for IPC communication.
# Turn this off to run the server without a window and hence without local protocol.
# Can be used for running a few instances of the server simultaneously on win32.
#
# Type: boolean
#
#CreateInternalWindow = 1

# Settings for Unix/Linux platforms
# ============================
#
#
# UNIX signal to use for interprocess communication 
#
# Type: integer
#
#LockSignal = 16


# ----------------------------
# Allow opening of data files on NFS volumes
#
# Allows for database files which exists on a NFS mounted partition to
# be opened by the engine.
#
# The original behavour was to try and connect to server on the remote
# machine via port 3050, this ensures that all opens of a file occur on
# the same machine and locking etc can be handled appropriately. However,
# this often causes frustration since often you end up in a position 
# where you really do want db files to be opened by the local process
# even though it resides on a NFS share.  So this option allows for this
# 'feature' to be turned off.
#
# Type: boolean
#
#RemoteFileOpenAbility = 0
